# Calculator_postfix
Calculator for evaluating mathematical expressions consisting of basic mathematical operations. Made with C++ in Visual Studio. The program uses Infix to Postfix conversion. 

"evaluate_expression_postfix_code" folder contains the code as text files. "miscellaneous" and "infixToPostfix" are header files.

# The calculator only works in Visual Studio. Will be fixed soon.
